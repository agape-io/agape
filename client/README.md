This is the client side of the Agape app which is powered by React Native.

We will use tools like Expo CLI to test our application.

* Make sure Expo CLI is already installed through `npm`,

## Installation
* On `client` run `yarn install` to download all dependencies.

## Running the application
* On `client` run `yarn start` and follow the Expo CLI prompts.
