# agape Client
This is the client side of the Agape app which is powered by React Native.

We will use tools such as Expo CLI to run and test our application.

**Make sure that the server is running at the same time in order to avoid 404 errors from our builtin API's.**

## Prepare the Environment
- Make sure you use Yarn for any sort of dependency installations within `client`.
- Make sure Expo CLI is already installed through `npm`,

## Initially Installing the Dependencies
In your Terminal or Command Prompt, run the following command at the `client` directory:
```
$ yarn install
```

## Running the application
In your Terminal or Command Prompt, run the following command at the `client` directory:
```
$ yarn start
```

## Adding New Dependencies for development
In your Terminal or Command Prompt, run the following command at the `client` directory:
```
$ yarn add some-dependency
```

## Other scripts to play with
In your Terminal or Command Prompt, run the following command at the `client` directory to clear Expo Cache:
```
$ yarn start-cache
```
